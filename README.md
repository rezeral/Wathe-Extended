**🚂 A train murder mystery social game**

This modpack expands [The Last Voyage of the Harpy Express](https://modrinth.com/modpack/harpy-express) with new roles, quality‑of‑life addons, furniture mods, performance improvements, and more customization options. It includes a fully decorated train + scenery by default, ready for you to modify.

> **INFO:** This modpack is currently in active development, and I’m not fully familiar with how the Modrinth App handles modpacks. Because of this, updates may occasionally cause issues. If you experience any problems after an update, try creating a fresh instance of the modpack to see if that fixes issues.
> If you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to make a report on [GitHub](https://github.com/rezeral/Wathe-Extended/issues)!
